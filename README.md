# Frontend Engineer Code Exercise

Code quality is very important to us.

We're sending you this exercise so that we can evaluate your coding skills and
knowledge in frontend development.

## Tasks

In this repository there are two tasks:

- A code review in the directory [/code-review](/code-review) where you
should familiarize yourself to the existing code, and submit a review to the PR
that is open.

- A code exercise in the directory [/code-exercise](/code-exercise) where you
should read the instructions, implement a solution and submit a PR.

Each directory has its own README with instructions.
